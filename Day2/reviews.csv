1035085,5229029371,P387511,5,1,1,3,0,3,11/29/22,"This cream is pricey, but it is so worth it! I started getting acne in my 20s from a stressful job  and tried a bunch of expensive products and procedures (chemical peels, facials, microdermabrasion). None of them worked as effectively as this one did. Since using this cream, my face has gotten smooth and soft. I rarely gets pimples now, and when I see one coming, I just apply this cream and it pretty much disappears overnight. On the downside, the fragrance does take a while to get used to because L’Occitane products tend to have a strong (but still pleasant) scent.",My holy grail
1035086,35439265952,P387511,2,0,0.5,4,2,2,8/12/22,"I used this in rotation with the Divine Youth Oil. Neither of these products left me feeling wowed in any way. If anything I found the cream slightly more effective than the oil, but at a price...red itchy spots on my cheeks and jawline area after 2 weeks of use. I’m guessing this was down to the Rosemary extract (the same ingredient that brings a rush of short-lived color to your cheeks - due to its stimulating effect on the skin). The Vitamin C in this did give me a glow which was good, and the texture of this cream was light and totally non-greasy. However something in it reacted negatively with my skin, causing bumps in areas I’ve never had bumps before. Definitely not something I could use as a daily moisturizer, at best, I’d say this is something I could use sparingly, every so often.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.

1035087,27285381637,P387511,4,0,1,6,0,6,2/18/22,I really did like this cream but I don’t think I’d buy it again just because of how expensive it is. It smells great with a slightly spicy scent and spreads so smoothly but leaves a slightly greasy feel after application. It’s really moisturizing and lasts a while too but I don’t think it’s a really good value for what it is.,

This weird thing always happens to me when I finish a jar - my skin is amazing while I’m using it, but then if I run out and don’t start a new jar right away, I get super dry patches around my nose and mouth area. It’s like it trains your skin to only accept this expensive af cream and then when you stop, your skin revolts. Anyway, I have oily skin and this never breaks me out. It’s a great cream, but the price makes replacing it annoying, and if I don’t replace it right away my skin freaks out.",

The employee of the factory told us all about the magic Immortelle flower and told us that this crème is new, they don’t sell it in the stores yet. I was tempted to buy it. And the bottle is so pretty, the scent is divine and the texture is amazing (creamy but light, not sticky at all). I have been using this creme for about 7 months and so far I haven’t seen any results. At the beginning I used it on my face (no results, even more - I noticed some breakouts) so I started using it on my neck and décolleté area. No results. It’s just a nice moisturizer that stays on until morning, helps with hydration but that’s about it. I won’t be repurchasing.",Beautiful bottle nothing else

My only complaint is the smell, it smells like a sunflower perfume so it’s a little overwhelming for me esp on my face. I’d be much happier if they just lessened the smell. Be prepared for a few pimples here and there while your skin gets used to the formula. It happens with all facial lotions. Don’t let it discourage you.","Skin feels good, don't like the smell"

It didn’t smell how I thought it would, even after reading the comments I can’t tell what all the smell hype is about. It’s not overwhelmingly fragrant and in comparaison to L’Occitane other products it does not meet my smell needs. BUT I wont be buying this product for the smell, I’m going to buy it for the amazingly soft skin it left me with the morning after application. Baby soft skin, smaller looking pores, and soaked in just how moisturizer should. I have combo skin and this did not make me overly oily. Felt good going on, felt even better the next day.

Weird thing about this cream is that it feels thin, isn’t all that hydrating, yet looks really oily on the skin, like it should be a thick, rich, hydrating cream. The smell is really pine-y, too.

I’m a lil’ skeptical of L’occitane face skin care at first, because my skin tends to react to fragrances, but that’s not the case with most French prodocts(like the L’occitane soap). This gives my dull face a slight glow in the morning. It is very moisturising. I don’t even use soap to rinse it off in the morning, because I only have 3 samples left.

The oils sank in beautifully and left glowy (but not oily) areas, which I really appreciated, but between the separation and the fragrance, even for a very low price, I wouldn’t consider this useful or effective. BTW, the reason I kept putting the word “wax“ in quotes is because I didn’t see wax in the ingredients list (maybe it is but I missed it?), but there’s some ingredient, or combination of ingredients that (on me) behaves similarly.

I also told her how she can purchase this product on Sephora with my other beauty secret;....Sephora’ selection of high quality make up products to choose from with extremely effecient, fast delivery, fun member benefits, promos, rewards and free gifts with purchase!I suggest comparing “gift with purchase“ offers between the official L’Occitane site and Sephora to decide which store offers the  best value. L’Occitane still sells my very first L’Occitane purchase of the DELUXE DEVINE GIFT Set (all skin types). If you can’t afford all of that..TRY the Divine Collecion set for half the price but less product. (these two packages are onlt for sale at L’Occirane online) I do suggest jumping to the Devine set tho cuz you’ll want more! L’Occitane is not as quick as Sephora’s unbeatable, lightening fast processing/delivery.Sephora also rewards with you points to use for various choices of make up or any beauty stuff.  This is my comment from the L’Occitane online reviews:**An absolutely amazing gift for yourself or a special friend who adores or dreams of high quality skin care. **Almost as good as getting a diamond ring!(you probably will get a diamond after using this stuff cuz you’ll have such a glow of natural beauty)**Skin is nourished and wrinkles and fatigue diminish.***Skin becomes goddess like.

Other benefits I’ve noticed include improving skin texture (again, more awake-looking) and moisturizing (of course it should do since it’s a moisturizer).

It does NOT remove dark circles or pimples (caused by staying up late) though.

Because the texture of this cream is slightly oily, I only put it on at night after cleansing. It takes a while to absorb on my face (combination skin) and leaves me quite shiny, but since it’s working while I sleep, it’s fine. The first morning I marveled at how soft my skin was - so velvety! By day three I can see that my skin looks firmer and smoother, and my pores are almost invisible! Now makeup goes on much more smoothly. In the winter my cheeks get dry and flaky and this cream has totally solved that problem. I’m all smooth and hydrated - yay! Cons: I don’t love the scent (it’s sweet and honey-ish/herbal/floral in the jar, but when it warms on my skin it’s really kind of bitter/medicinal smelling), but since I only smell it for a little while before I go to sleep, it’s not a deal breaker.

This lovely cream has many wonderful oils and extracts, and to top that off, it contains ascorbyl glucoside, a stable form of vitamin C (brightening, anti-aging, even sun protection) listed relatively high on the list. Although slightly more oily, in feel and look, than what I prefer, I know my skin is benefiting greatly to these fabulous oils so I just couldn’t take a star off for that. On top of that, I know how difficult it is to formulate something with vitamin C as it can 1. break down and lose efficacy 2. irritate skin if too much is used 3. often feel sticky and sometimes doesn’t absorb into skin. This cream’s texture made me feel like there is no vitamin C used, and yet I wake up with plump and brightened skin that its benefits provide.

I’m 45 Caucasian with skin that has been on the oiler side most of my life. Now that I’m getting older my concerns are for firmness, texture, fine lines, and dullness. I have always been skeptical that a cream can do anything to actually help skin, but I must say since I’ve been using it there has been quite a difference in the whole appearance of both my face and neck. My skin is firmer, brighter, softer, smoother. The fine lines are disappearing, my whole complexion looks refreshed and just younger - even my 16 year old daughter has noticed. Some of the milia are even starting to disappear which is amazing in itself. My neck is firmer, too. It is made with essential oils (which accounts for the scent) but it’s not greasy. As with any oil product, you need to use a very small amount as a little goes a long way and give it a few minutes to absorb (also, you should be using a toner or essence before as cream does not absorb well into fully dry skin - it should be a little dewy) . This is now a staple in my beauty routine - the only other staple I have is the SK-II Essence.",It Actually Works - A new staple for me

Joke’s on me, unfortunately. I’m in love!

A few notes: This is a very dense cream. It feels thick, but not necessarily oily on application. A little goes a long way, especially if you’re wearing it during the day. Some people may be most comfortable using this as a night cream. I was able to successfully use it as both, but start small.

Despite how heavy the cream feels, it didn’t leave me with a residue or an oily, tacky feeling. It did dry down completely - which is a problem for me, typically. I have combination-oily skin and struggle with cream moisturizers for that reason. 

I felt a difference pretty promptly in the texture of my skin (uneven skin in cheeks/forehead) and it only improved over the course of the week I trialed this. 

Tips:
Again, it’s heavy. A little goes a long way. 
It does have a fragrance. It’s light and not obtrusive, but if scent is an issue for someone: pass on this.
I was able to use it underneath makeup during the day but applied it pretty selectively to my problem areas, avoiding my T-zone. 

I’m bummed. I really didn’t want to like this. Unfortunately, I came out in love. That said, for how little I use on a daily basis, the 1.7oz stands to last me quite some time.",Didn't want to love it but--

This product is a little thick and does have a soft pleasant fragrance that fades and it is extremely moisturizing. It’s full of oils and does give you a shiny oily feel after application. With that said, I don’t see how this cream could work during the day. Makeup just balls up or slides around! It would have been better marketed as a night cream. I have normal skin and I use this at night and by morning my skin is hydrated, glowing and plump. Amazing! I would definitely repurchase to use at night. I took away a star because I feel like this should be a night cream as it takes several hours for my skin to start absorbing all the oils and be remotely ready for makeup application.

But honestly I think so much of this is overhyped and due to branding. It is very nourishing which I like and has no silicones.

I actually tried this creme a few years back (in my 20s), my skin hated it then and it disapproved it by protesting with a bunch of milia and tiny pimples. The moment I hit my big 3, my skin decided to act wild (extra sensitive in forms of flame ups and pimples) and I tried various products, but this was the only thing that calmed it down. Yes, after a few years my skin decided it likes “miracle broth,“ wasted my money back then. What a grumpy and demanding child! I started with a mini emulsion and creme (gifts from La Mer), then I ran to grab the full size emulsion and creme... And because my skin loved it so much, I bought the creme duet set and another full size emulsion just to make sure I have backups.The creme feels similar to Nivea cream, but it’s not the same... I tried to get my skin to like Nivea but it simply didn’t like it and didn’t calm anything down, it’s a great moisturizer for the body though. The smell of Creme de La Mer is more elegant than the smell of Nivea Cream. Someone said rotten seaweed, perhaps they got a bad batch? I love the smell, a very calming sensorial flight for me every time I use it (AM and PM, and sometimes mid day if I go out and decide to wash my face mid day). I use two pumps of emulsion then follow up with a pearl size of creme warmed up between my finger tips and patted on. My skin calmed, smoothed, lifting, and firmed; and my skin haven’t glow like this since my teens. Will keep repurchasing until my skin decides it likes another product! The price isn’t bad, you only need a pearl size each time, a 7mL lasts me 2wks and 15mL 4wks with me using it almost 3 times every day. I bought the creme duet which is a 60mL + 15mL and that should last me a while.

Another thing to remember is this is for really dry skin. If you’ve relatively ’normal’ skin in relatively moderate weather (ie, not tropical, not desert) you are not going to see miraculous results. If you have relatively young skin as well as the above? You are not going to see miraculous results. It’s not as thick as it seems when used properly, though it is intensely moisturising. It’s wonderful in winter. I also use it during The Allergy Months as it helps when my skin gets red, scratchy, and irritated. It’s nice on cuticles, dry knuckles and elbows.

I had recently watched a scientist review this very product from a scientific perspective. I was intrigued by the fact- based evidence, Creme de la Mer is  made of high quality ingredients it claims to be and performs the way it is intended to- not many brands can say that! That being said, I had high expectations of the creme, which were met! I love the consistency, it is quite thick and being so I initially though it would cause my face to feel greasy, but it did not. Creme de la Mer is unique as the product is meant to be warmed between your fingers, this causes it to become nearly translucent and also easier to apply. It glided across my skin, and despite the consistency, it didn’t feel heavy.  After the first day of using it, both morning and night, my skin was very moisturized and had a nice glow. After a few more days of use  my skin tone looked more even, and  was better hydrated and plump. I would definitely recommend Creme de la Mer to anyone wanting to purchase it.

It has a nice light scent and is rich and thick but this is a negative for me because it doesn’t smooth easily over my skin and even feels like it pulls a bit so I found myself tapping it on instead.

This is a huge waste, especially with this being a high end luxury product.  Once the moisturizer is warmed between your fingers you gently press it on to your face and neck.

They note a little goes a long way which is very true! It is expensive but since you do not need much it will last a long time. Also, make sure to warm up the product between your fingers to make sure it is at its prime consistency when you apply. I hate when products leave my skin oily after applying but this absorbs in so nicely.  I love the glow it gives me for no makeup days. I have dry skin and this definitely provides enough daily moisture. Worth the splurge.",

A little really does go a long way and I enjoy patting it into my skin during my morning and night routine. The smell is a little strong but I don’t mind scents in skincare. It sinks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling moisturized but not overly so. You have to rub between your fingers until it becomes translucent prior to application.

I absolutely love the cream, though I admit I was skeptical at first because of the price, and the fact that people say that it’s thick and hard to spread. There’s a right way to do it! You need to take a little bit and warm it up first, by tapping your fingers together. It gets buttery smooth and much easier to apply. I found that I actually enjoyed it. It made my skin really soft. Price is an issue, but I figure, I’d rather spend $200 on a jar of cream that lasts me a year, than a beauty box subscription that comes with stuff that I’ll never use and that just clutters up my bathroom, and does nothing for my skin.

A tiny bit goes a long way. I take half a dime sized amount and warm it between my fingertips. This actually changes its consistency from a thick cream to a thinner, easier to spread cream.

Worth it’s weight in gold is the first thing that comes to mind. First, I love the velvet bag it comes in. Its screams high end from the get go. Now on to the product itself. Although you might think the price is high I can testify a little really goes a long way which is savings in the end especially if it genuinely works. My skin is combination but as I’ve aged I deffinatly have more wrinkles, sags and bags. All the fun stuff that comes with age. Once you emulsify a very small amount between your fingers and smooth it on I noticed it was like a velvet canvas on my face. It dident leave a oily residue type feeling. I put this on before my makeup and it just made for a very even and smooth surface  to work with. It dident make things look caked either. Im so glad I has a chance to try this out, I’m sold.

The special instructions did make using it feel “fancy” ( for lack of a better word).  I used it only at night but there is no way I could apply primer, sunscreen and makeup over this heavy cream.  ( believe me , I tried and it was a fail in 90° heat)   When I woke in the morning, my face was smooth and glowy  and baby soft.  I loved it as a nighttime cream and I believe it did it’s job as a moisturizer.  Here’s the thing.   It’s not  $300 good.  Ive used other $50 moisturizers that are HG’s  for me.

It penetrates deep into the skin, has a very nice light scent to it, and has a consistency different to any other moisturizer I have ever tried. While the price is sort of insane, I would reserve this product only for those who have high income as there are other alternatives that are cheaper such as Belif or Tatcha. Mind you, this indulgence will leave your skin looking amazing all day and will absorb during the night, making you look like you just stepped out of a facial all throughout the day. I couldn’t be happier. Just got the La Mer Moisturizing Soft Cream and will compare.

I can’t think of anything to compare it to except baby diaper cream. It has such a thick white texture like diaper cream or possibly natural zinc sunscreen. When I put it on my face it made my face look very very greasy. It soaked in a little bit but I had to wash most of it off because it felt and looked so greasy. I am confused about the ‘miracle’ that this cream is supposed to be. If I had bought it for $5 at the supermarket, I would say it would have been fair value as a product to put on the dry skin on my feet for instance, but I certainly would not be interested in putting this on my face again.

My likes for this are: amazing for dry skin in the winter, the ingredients like algae, it helps my thinning skin barrier on my cheeks, it absorbs quickly when warmed up between the fingers or palms of the hands. Do not put it on straight from the spatula to your face. It will not spread well and cause you to press harder than needed to work the product into your facial skin. The scent is a little strong at first, but wears off. It’s almost like a baby powder scent. This is a very thick cream, so you might feel greased for a good 5 minutes, but as it absorbs, it feels light and your skin will feel pillowy and moisturized. This product is extremely expensive and effective. A little goes a long way. It’s tempting to scoop a quarter sized blob, but a dime size at MOST is more than enough for moisturizing. My dislikes are- the absorbtion time takes 15 minutes for me. If I am in a rush to do my makeup, this cream is not a good team player as a prep for that. I’d rather use Tatcha, Lancôme, Tula, Dermologica or First Aid Beauty. They seem to absorb faster as a skin prep step for makeup. This product lasts a long time.

I don’t use it in the summer, when it can sometimes look like it’s making my pores look bigger and by morning doesn’t seem to have fully absorbed. If your skin is red/irritated or very dry, this is nice, thick enough to feel luxurious, good enough scent, and it really calms down my skin when it is red or irritated. Before applying you’re supposed to “warm it between your fingertips“ = rub it between your fingers before patting it on as far as I can tell.  The plus side of this is that it reminds you to pat on lotion instead of rubbing it on (which pulls skin), but honestly I find it pretty annoying and semi regularly forget to “warm it“ first.

Then I could no longer afford it so I tried every cream you can imagine. I tried every free sample I could get my hands on and no other brand could keep my skin hydrated. The closest one I could find was Olay Regenerist which worked for a couple weeks and then it was back to dry flaky patches on my face again. I started using La Mer again in 2011 and I am so happy. No dryness at all. And it pairs well with the La Mer foundation too. If you have super dry skin this is the moisturizer for you!!! Pricey but worth it.,

This also has citrus extracts which are extremely irritating and are basically fragrances. Fragrance is also in this, however, it is the very last ingredient so it’s not too big of a deal. But the citrus extracts are fragrant and irritating in themselves. This cream isn’t worth the high price tag. There are SO many creams here at Sephora or even the drugstore that have amazing long term benefits with much more special ingredients.

I’ve been using nivea creme for the past month to help with very dry winter skin and have loved the feel and results.  I find both a tad on the thick side which creates a lot of tugging on the skin unless you have the patience to pat on your moisturizer.  I’ve been adding about 4 drops of kiehls midnight repair serum  (another must have) and it really helps to thin it out enough for a smoother application (highly recommend).  And in 100% honesty after having tried both I prefer the nivea creme.  When it dries it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin which I found la mer does and makes it hard to apply makeup on.  And the other obvious con is the price.  Other then that these products are practically identical right down to the scent.  I am honestly shocked so many people would choose la mer over nivea.

The sample lasted me for a month and it didn’t do anything special for my skin. Some of my favorite moisturizers do more to hydrate and smooth my skin throughout the day and are at least 60% cheaper than this product. La Mer’s big schtick is that their “miracle brew“ is composed of fermented sea kelp; there are plenty of other brands and products that have sea kelp that are more effective and at a much lower price point. This product did not keep my skin hydrated all day, like it claims, which is saying something since I don’t deal with dry skin in the first place.If someone wants a luxury product for the sake of it, by all means, go nuts.

I have very dry, sensitive skin, and once I started using it, I noticed a difference in my skin very quickly. Because of the cost, I tried many other products that my favorite staff at Sephora told me are “similar“ - which they might be for women who’s skin isn’t as dry and sensitive as mine (I would LOVE to save some money!). But none of them worked as well. Basically, I went from having skin issues to having perfect skin. I don’t think everyone will have such dramatic results, because not everyone needs such a rich cream. The Soft Cream is less rich, and I know people with normal or oily skin who really like it. I love the other La Mer products as well (the serum is awesome) and look forward to promotions that include large samples, but the 2 ounce original cream is always in my medicine cabinet. Even with nothing else, it’s all I really need. For those who love La Mer, FYI a few times a year La Mer does a promotion where a 2 ounces jar comes in a gift set with a .5 ounce jar - I usually try to make mine last until then because an extra .5 ounces is a huge savings :) Sometimes this is offered in stores (I first saw at Bloomingdales) but it’s also on their website, which has free shipping and usually some gift with purchase.

It’s so expensive I thought either it has gold in it or people are getting ripped off here. I WAS WRONG. I received a sample of this and used it religiously every night for about a month. The sample was small so I really stretched it out. I started getting tons of compliments about my skin. I noticed that in pictures my skin was smooth, glowing, even-toned, and my lines less noticeable to name only a few of the many improvements. I had started using a few new products along with the Creme de La Mer sample, so I thought nothing of it. Sure enough, my sample ran out and I stopped using it altogether. Even with my new intense skincare routine my skin started going downhill slowly. After a month without using La Mer I looked in the mirror one day and I felt discouraged because I was having breakouts again, my skin did not look as even, my skin just didn’t look like it had before. It was the only thing I had taken out of my routine. So it’s safe to say I made the investment and bought Creme de La Mer again.

In combination with my hormonal breakouts, I felt like a zombie whose face was about to melt off. I stopped all products and just went for the La Mer concentrate followed by a big scoop of this cream. I did the same thing the next morning, and when I took off my makeup tonight I was shocked! My scars quite obviously faded, my skin tone was more even and generally brighter, and my entire face looked plump and hydrated with even smaller pores! My face looked like it just enjoyed a nice sheet mask and not covered in makeup for 13 hours. Just two uses was able to repair my zombie-apocalypse face and made it look much better than before.

536249,5149274579,P416341,3,1,NA,0,0,0,1/30/19,So I bought this moisturizer with high hopes. I am a make up artist and have studied skin care for a very long time now. My skin regimen is not for the faint of heart. My skin care is anywhere from 7 to 10 steps. So I figured incorporating an amazing moisturizer might be the key to see an even greater difference. Through my skin care I have gone from oily to combo oily. Although I did like the moisturizer I feel like I have not seen a big enough difference. I have acne prone skin and while I am happy to say has not caused any more acne I feel like the rest of my skin care has caused a bigger difference than this moisturizer. Now if I was rich and had money to blow I would definitely continue buying this hoping that maybe I might see a difference. However the price I do not think it is worth it so much. Like if I was rich and wanted to live in luxury then I would buy it. I’m not saying it’s a bad moisturizer it’s actually a good one. But I feel like it might be better for someone with really dry skin or for someone that is really only considering their moisturizer as their main component of skin care almost. For example maybe someone that has a very simple routine can benefit more from a higher end Moisturizer. Yet since my skin Routine is extensive I really don’t see this moisturizer making much of a difference. Maybe when I get older and maybe I get a little dryer I might re-purchase this.,luxury but meh

I even had to start applying a facial oil before applying la Mer because the la Mer just wasn’t enough on its own... my skin was becoming drier and drier. This is absolutely not what I anticipated from such an iconic product. If I hadn’t been using my PTR C serum for the last 6 months, which has been a game changer for my skin, perhaps I would’ve seen more improvement in my skin tone. The reviewers that claim that la Mer dramatically calmed their skin down makes me think they were unknowingly using something previously that was inflammatory. For a product at this price point, I cannot justify having to also use an expensive vitamin c serum AND add in a facial oil to compensate for the drying effects of long term use of this product. La Mer also did absolutely nothing for the fine lines on my forehead. So what am I left with? Dewy skin in the first few hours after application, but overall drier skin than before starting this product and a need to find something for my fine lines. Overall, not worth it at all. Too bad.",Drying! And not multi purpose.

I love the packaging of this and there are so many people that swear by it, so I figured, why not!? Also, it was one of those “treat yo-self” kind of moments – lets be real, this cream is expensive.  I have to say, I was not expecting some kind of miracle. I actually expected this to be a pretty basic boujee cream that I would enjoy and then move on from. I have a really hard time finding skincare that keeps my attention, I will rarely buy the same moisturizer twice. Well, I have to say, I am converted. Not only will I save my pennies to buy this again, I can’t stop using it! Normally I rotate my night creams, but with this one, I look so forward to putting it on at night that I don’t want to use anything else. My skin is moisturized, has less redness, is more even and my fine lines and forehead wrinkles are less apparent. To say I am shook is an understatement.

I would try it in another formula, I think they make a lighter texture one, if it had less perfume. I like to smell my actual perfume throughout the day, not my face cream.

It was thick to the point of being a little difficult to spread.  I found this to be a sticking point because it wasn’t really quick to use on my eye area.  Also, I tend to be suspicious of creams that are overly thick because it simply means they are full of thickening agents.I also didn’t care for the smell.  It smelled just like a drugstore brand that my mom used to use which I never liked.  (It came in a blue jar with white lettering.)What I was impressed with was that it made my area noticeably plumper.  Although I must say that the cream left the area moist since it’s so thick.  Thus, I wouldn’t use this during the day.  I was further impressed by how even my skin-tone was around my eyes.  I couldn’t stop looking in the mirror.  For those two reasons, I seriously thought about purchasing this product.  However, a few things held me back.

I feel that the soft cream is nice but leaves a film vs. my skin just drinks this up from a small bit of this melted pressed into my skin. I agree with previous posters, this is not the cream to rub into your skin. You definitely have to warm up a little until your finger tips are clear, then press on slightly damp (I use the essence prior). A pea size is good for my entire face and neck. I use a q tip instead of the spatula. So far, I haven’t noticed any break outs from this despite mineral oil and it honestly sinks into my skin and keeps it dewy and moisturized without feeling like there’s a layer of moisturizer on top of your skin.

I use the foaming cream, cleansing oil, cleansing gel or oil scrub depending on my needs that day or week. Another tip is to try a serum underneath to prep your skin. The Genaissance de la Mer is amazing and so is the renewal serum. I also use the eye cream and lip balm...they are the best on the market!!

After the first jar I got I could prob say I was a little underwhelmed. I loved the texture, it did feel a little greasy but I don’t mind that since my skin is kinda dry. The application party I for some reason couldn’t totally get the hang of. You have to warm it on your finger tips til it turns clear. Sometimes that would happen and other times it would still stay a whitish color. Idk why it’s so complicated for me lol but that is part of the process that is supposed to make this miracle like. I don’t know that I saw a huge difference in my skin after the first jar, however without make up I did get compliments on how my skin looked ( I don’t have break out or blemishes..I’m in my mid 30s so my focus is mainly hydration, evening skin tone and anti aging benefits) However the time came when I ran out and I decided to see if I could find something comparable that was less expensive. Nope. My skin started to get a lot of redness I had some minor break out and my skin looked dull and not as firm.

I’ve been eyeing it for years (not an exaggeration) but the price always kept me away. My most recent regimen was by Rodan   Fields. Prior to that I had tried products like No. 7, Vichy, and every drugstore brand you can think of. My skin is dehydrated, oily, I have large pores and endless blackheads. A bit of sun damage and “mommy tiredness“ round out my look. I have been searching for something that will hydrate my skin, as the few fine lines I have really could benefit from moisture. Anti aging products I’ve tried have left my skin dry.Enter La Mer. Upon first glance it seems pretentious - the brand has a colorful backstory, and the product contains “miracle broth“ and is used by a ton of celebrities. It comes with special application instructions. It seemed foolish. The creme is thick like diaper paste and requires warming between your fingertips to emulsify it, at which point you pat/press the product into your skin. The first two times I tried this I got it wrong and ended up rubbing it in, which I immediately regretted as it’s too thick and really you end up pulling on your skin to apply it. But once I got the hang of it, boy I really started to love bedtime. I only use this at night because I think it’s too costly to use twice a day, and if I used it in the daytime I would also need a sunscreen product. At night I usually shower, cleanse, tone and La Mer my skin. It feels so luxurious. The next morning my skin looks refreshed and glowing. Best of all, it feels and looks hydrated!The only drawback for me is the price, but I don’t believe I should give the product 4 stars based on that, because I do think the product is lovely. And because of it’s paste-like texture I have a hard time using less product (to try to spare it along) because I need so much to rub between my fingers to emulsify it.

I’d continue to spring for this if it was like that. If it was earth-moving.  If it was life-changing.But, it’s not. Maybe my expectations were too high (lol?), but this isn’t the holy grail of skin creams; at least not in my experience.Previously, I had been using some anti aging products that had made the skin under my eyes nasty flaky and super sensitive. My whole face, really, was stressed out. So I thought this would be a great way to fix it. Well... yes and no; it did but it didn’t.Yes - this is a lovely moisturizer and my foundation (Tarte amazonian clay) goes on gorgeously after applying it. I used it under my eyes, too, and it made the flakiness and damage go away.  So, yes. Yes, it worked. BUT: it also left me with milia (those little white bumps that are horrible to pop) all over under my eyes and even out into my crows feet and beyond. (I was using it 2x/day). Still, when I cut back to 1x/day I still had to be VERY careful around my eyes (and the milia are still there, dang it).Yes, my skin is softer. But ultimately, I don’t get what all the hype is. Am I using it wrong? IDK: it’s not carried at any Sephora near me so I have no one to ask (btw: stanks a lot for that, Sephora). I just can’t justify this kind of money for what I got from this.  Maybe if I had more than an once to play with, I could find the right way to use it for my skin, but alas; I could only justify the 1oz container at this price.I’m violently disappointed.  :(. ~sigh~",So disappointing.

I would usually get dry skin patches, flanky nose and outbreaks for no reason! I tried a lot of different moisturizers but at best I could only make this irritation to lesser extend but not completely gone. Until I started using the creme de la mer from beginning of October, nothing happened at all during the transition from autumn to cold winter!! I was very surprised and literally shocked!! I feel my skin very moisturized all day long even I used it only in the night time together with the treatment lotion. I find my skin more stable and have less and less outbreak. I have combination skin but with dry cheek and nose in colder months. My pores are also appeared smaller and my skin overall looks radiant and healthy, even without foundation! It doesn’t have any fancy function like whitening or anti-aging/firming, but this cream definitely makes your skin looks more supple!

I *was* skeptical and wanted to hate it (still do kinda), but I just don’t. Yes, I think the price is crazy (and don’t think I didn’t notice the price jumped from $215 to $230, Sephora), but this has made such a big difference in my skin since I started using it a couple months ago. Doesn’t make the price tag easier to swallow, but I’ve totally drunk the Kool-Aid.I mostly use it at night because it’s very thick and I have combo to oily skin (although I don’t like the Soft Cream), and frankly I want it to last as long as humanly possible. If I don’t use it one night, I immediately notice the difference in my glow, smoothness, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles the next morning. That sealed the deal for me. Tried the Nivea dupe and it just doesn’t compare. Fortunately a little goes a long way, and you MUST warm it up beforehand or it doesn’t spread/absorb properly. I cleanse with micellar water or the Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleanser, then follow with Etude House toner and Drunk Elephant Framboos serum, then La Mer, and my skin looks incredible the next day, just lit from within, smooth, and with significant reduction in fine lines. I’m 32 and I’ve constantly been getting compliments on how I look 10 years younger with my current routine. During the day I use the DE C-Firma and B-Hydra and the Murad Essential-C Day Moisture with SPF. This combination has my skin looking the best it ever have. (See filter-free photo below.)I can’t justify the expense of the rest of the line, but if you use this consistently and in combination with other quality skincare products that work (for you), your skin will look great.

I broke out with a couple of spots in the first couple of days but they rapidly cleared and I haven’t had any since. I also had a rough patch under my chin, sort of like chicken skin (if you have this you’ll know what I’m talking abou)...it’s gone!

1. If you’re 20-something, you probably already have great skin, so this really will seem like “snake oil“ to you. Stop messing with your face!!! I’m 36, so I’m being more diligent about maintaining my skin. 
2. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. A pea sized dollop, rub between your fingers to “heat“ and then PAT, don’t RUB this into your skin. The people who are rubbing it into their skin are misapplying it. I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but trust me. If you pat, the jar will also last a lot longer!","Great for Dry, Red Skin -- Read the Instructions!"

Like so dry that if I don’t put anything on after I wash, it’s so tight and itches all over. I have searched for the perfect Creme for many years. I have read about this before but the price put me off, but finally my hubby felt bad that I was so upset about my skin that he got me the 1 oz. I was shocked and prayed that this would be it. After I figured out how to warm up the creme (to release the miracle broth that La Mer is known for) and pat it on my face (you gotta use some pressure to really get it in the skin) and then I massage it well.

As an Asian American, I am religiously following the double cleansing and 10 step skincare routine. It has definitely paid off. You only get one integumentary system (your skin is an organ system) so take care of it. Plus I have read some 1 star reviews and the problem is easy to fix. La Mer doesn’t only have the thick creme. It comes in a soft creme formulation for normal/combo and the lotion for oily skin. There is a formulation for EVERY skin type. You just have to educate yourself. I guarantee that if they used the right La Mer moisturizer, they would love it as much as I do and many others. There is a reason why this is celebrity’s favorite creme!! It’s worth every penny. Just make sure you have the right skincare system for your skin, not just the creme.

The downsides are that, after my first 2 weeks of using La Mer, my skin seemed drier and I broke out for the first time in years.  I’m not sure if my breakout is related to using product, but the rest of my skin routine has remained the same and my healthy diet hasn’t changed.

It is suppised to be filled with sea plant based antioxidants. The problem is that anti oxidants, oxidize quickly when in contact with air, so I wonder how the anti oxidants contained in this product are stabilized in an open jar container.

Some people swear by it, but using this alone isn’t enough for those with very dry or very sensitive skin.  My more detailed review video is below.",Just okay

I took a chance and dropped the cash on this. It is truly worth every penny. In 2 days my skin is hydrated, glowing, and healing. I’m hooked. For those who claim this is all hype - you are the exception, not the rule. You either didn’t give it a chance, or your skin is an anomaly. This stuff is legit. It’s not hype. It’s amazing and worth the money if you really want to see a significant change in your skin.",HOLY GRAIL!

I have very oily/combo skin and I lightly scrape the tip of my nail to get a very small Amt, like 1/3 of a pea size, and smooth that on. The past few days I’ve have NO pores, my skin looks lush and hydrated but still smooth and not oily. I think the oily reviews are using too much. If you have dry spots and want more on that part, after smoothing it on, pat some into the dry spot using the bottom of your finger the same idea as patting on eye cream or the pat pat from a beauty blender. Everyone should try this at least once!",use just a lil!!

I use it every night and I think it’ll still last me another month, so if you average the price, you’ll be spending $50 a month or so on a moisturizer. It is, however, the best face cream I’ve ever used. It’s so good that I feel bad for the others. Ha ha ha my skin is soft and luminous. I use a lot of anti-aging products and this takes care of all the abrasion and dryness some of them give! I’ll def try the lighter version during the warm months!

I’m a skincare junkie so I’ve tried a lot of moisturizers. I find that I’m not grabbing this one as a first choice. My main skin concerns are moister and anti-aging. It definitely provides moisture and I find I like to use it more at night than under makeup but it doesn’t give me that wow factor? Don’t get me wrong, it’s good. I’m just thinking about the cost factor compared to other really amazing skincare creams out there that are half the price and do the same if not more. La Mer for sure has a cult following and is an elite line so if you have the means you should try it in your lifetime. If you have scars or recently had surgery this seems to be the go to miracle cream.",better than ok but not the best

No matter what though, I come back to the coveted crème de la Mer. Many will claim it’s hype and suggest dupes, but nothing compares to it (imo). My skin feels so soft and supple when I use this, and I have this certain ~glow. I started using this at 18, and now at 32 I get many compliments on my skin and no one believes my age. The price is intimidating, but because you use so little the jar lasts a very long time. I’m so happy Sephora now carries it.

You need very little product. After using this cream for two months the lines around my eyes and mouth have reduced A LOT! Even my husband told me that my face looks “pulled back“ lol. I love this cream because not only does it help keep my skin soft but it has also helped minimize lines. So happy Sephora carries the line now!! :)",Love!!

I only use two La Mer products, this one and the Intensive Revitalizing Mask, and my skin has never looked better.  I tried Botox a few years ago and it didn’t work.  It literally did nothing.  I had resigned myself to embracing my glabellar lines, those pesky lines between the brows, until I started using this face cream.  I am weeks away from turning 50 and those lines are nowhere to be seen.  They have vanished.  So to me, this is definitely worth the price tag.  My skin is soft and supple and it feels so comfortable.  And finally - I can reach my VIB rouge reward points even faster now that Sephora carries this line!",Best face cream EVER

I used this for years when I lived in Dallas & stopped buying it because it is not sold in my local department stores after we moved. Love that Sephora carries the .5 oz jars so you don’t have to worry about the larger jars oxidizing (that was always a concern of mine.)

It’s expensive, granted, however it lasts for a long time and you just won’t get these great results from other creams.  Check on the la mer website how to apply it.

I’ve used La Mer on and off for years and recently fell back in love. I enjoyed the products in my 20s but at 37, this cream is life. It absorbs quickly for a thick cream and melts into your skin. I like to mis with a few drops of the Renewing Oil (another amazing product) and my skin is moisturizer and lit from within. And there is nothing like it in terms of making your skin so baby soft!!  I used that combo last night after Sunday Riley’s Good Genes and my skin has never looked better. I like the Soft Cream too, especially in the summer, and will probably switch to it when my Moisturizing Cream is gone. Am I irritated that the ingredients are hard (impossible?) to find?  Sure.

I was taught that the tapping and the warmth released more of the benefits. It is not for anti-aging however, it is only for moisture - I get far more anti-aging benefit with other products. Also this is too heavy for summer, it’s more of a winter product for me (and I have dry skin and live in New England).

I typically like to use this at night so it can really do its work without makeup layered over it. You only need a very little amount of this product & it must be warmed up between your fingers until it appears somewhat translucent, then you press it gently into the skin.
